    "This first function uses the Maclaurin power series representation to calculate the value of sin at any given x value. For any x<2pi, I found that using 10 terms is a good quantity to get an accurate enough calculation. Perhaps I would consider some sort of detection for cases with larger x values or maybe let the user choose their own quantity of terms so they can fine-tune the function to be as accurate as they desire. There is probably a prettier way to write this code without a massive append statement but I do not know the functions to achieve that right now."

    "Here we are computing the sine and cosine results at every input, storing them into their respective lists, and then incrementing the \"while\" loop by 2pi/1000 so that we get 1000 calculations between 0-2pi as instructed. I had used the commented section to test my results and forgot to remove it so it's staying there. I opted for 2 separate values for x (x1 and x2) and xList (x1List and x2List) because I do not remember if python executes code lines sequentially or not and I wanted to avoid undefined behavior in my code so I chose to take the more data-intensive route and create 2 separate lists (this could be far more optimized for memory). To generalize this function, I would allow the user to choose their own upper limit for calculation and also how many calculations they would like to use for each function. At the end we are returning because I want to print specifically the first 10 calculations for each and also I wanted to do a separate function for the main to keep the code as organized as possible."

    "This is the main function. The primary purpose of this is to print the data in an organized way. Since above, we created a matrix that's 3x1000 and we want the first 10 results from eaach function, we first enter a for loop set to a limit of 10, then we grab each index by saying trigVals[Row][Col] which as example works out like so: trigVals[0][1] would be index 1,2 in the matrix. In this case, it would be the second recorded x value which is 0+(2pi/1000) which is 0.00628...\n",
